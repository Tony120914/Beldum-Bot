# Beldum-Bot
<img src="https://github.com/Tony120914/Beldum-Bot/blob/master/images/374Beldum-Shiny.png?raw=true" width=200px align="right">

This is a Discord bot developed using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), a node.js module.

What's a Beldum? It's one of my favourite [Pokemon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Beldum_(Pok%C3%A9mon))!
